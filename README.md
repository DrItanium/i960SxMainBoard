This is the kicad project for my basic i960Sx mainboard

This is the culmination of many different designs with the most prominent being
the flattening of my internal modular board design. It was made up of mega2560
shield form factors and nucleo-144 form factor boards. It allowed me to mix and
match ideas without having to fully lay everything out over and over again. I
have no plans of releasing those designs publically because they are not
useful to anyone but myself.

This is a mini-itx board that requires a separate MightyCore development board
to plug into. This board is the culmination of years of work and design. I am
nowhere done but this is the next phase of the design
